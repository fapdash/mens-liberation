## Quotes
„In patriarchal society men who want to break with domination can best begin the practice of love by being giving, by being generous.“
 – bell hooks in All About Love
 
„If men were socialized to desire love as much as they are taught to desire sex, we would see a cultural revolution.“
 – bell hooks in All About Love
 
„Most males are not told that they need to be upheld by love every day. Sexist thinking usually prevents them from acknowledging their longing for love or their acceptance of a female as their guide on love’s path.“
 – bell hooks in All About Love
 
„Yet the vast majority of males in our society are convinced that their erotic longing indicates who they should, and can, love. Led by their penis, seduced by erotic desire, they often end up in relationships with partners with whom they share no common interests or values.“
 – bell hooks in All About Love

On the one hand, the starting point was an increasing and stronger debate about sexism, heterosexism, patriarchal structures, concrete accusations of rape or outings of rapists within radical communities. On the other hand, the steady growth of the small men’s movement contributed to the emergence of the newsletter.
